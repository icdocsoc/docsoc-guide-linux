You've already learnt about `ls` and `cd`. Now, we'll teach you some more useful (nay, essential) Linux commands.

Don't worry if the following list of commands seems very long at first. After lots of experience with using the Linux terminal you'll gradually start to memorise how each one works.

## `touch`

This is a really easy command. `touch <filename>` simply creates an empty file with that name in your working directory! Here it is demonstrated:

![touch](assets/commands/touch.png "touch")

```
Note that files don't have to end with an extension like `.txt`. They can be called whatever you want! Files only have extensions so that programs know what to do with that type of file.
```

## `cat`

`cat <filename>` prints the contents of that file to your screen. The filename must be the name of a file that exists in your working directory.

![cat](assets/commands/cat.png "cat")

```
Whenever something is printed to the screen it belongs to what is called a 'stream'. There are two output streams, called stdout and stderr, and one input stream called stdin. This is quite an advanced topic but for more information, see the Streams section.
