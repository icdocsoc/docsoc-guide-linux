# Package managers

```
Brief (to be removed)

apt-get (for Debian)
yum (for Fedora)
brew (for mac)
```
Every Linux distro comes with its own package management system, which is a program that allows you to download other programs off the Internet through the command line. This is incredibly important for installing 3rd party software on your Linux computer, for example OpenOffice, vim, or git.
